## Hi there 👋

My name is Luís Silva. I am a software engineering student and enthusiast building products that turn software into meaningful solutions.

🚀 What I'm Working On

⏱️ Clockwork – a Flutter app for personal and team productivity, with local-first data storage, Firebase sync, and smart reporting.

🤖 N.O.V.A. – my fully local, personalized AI assistant, powered by Ollama, with memory routing and a future cross-device UI.

🖥️ Homelab Manager – a Flutter desktop + Android app for browsing, managing, and transferring files to/from my Ubuntu-based home server over SSH.

🛠️ My Toolbox

Hardware: ESP32 (C3, H2), LSM6DS3, BLE, battery monitoring, PCB design & optimization

Software: Flutter, Firebase, Hive, Python, C/C++ (ESP-IDF, Arduino)

AI/ML: local LLM integration with Ollama

Other: 3D printing (Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro)

📚 Currently Learning

Advanced PCB design and power optimization techniques

ML model improvement for sensor data classification

Secure and efficient data syncing between local DBs and cloud services

🌱 What Drives Me

I’m driven by the challenge of turning complex ideas into simple, deployable solutions.
